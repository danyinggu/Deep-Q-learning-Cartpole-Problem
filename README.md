# Deep-Q-learning-Cartpole-Problem
Description: This project is to train an agent to solve the CartPole problem in OpenAI Gym by implementing a Deep Q Network. The Gym package can be downloaded from gym.openai.com. 

Basic Idea: Since CartPole has a continuous state space, it cannot use a table representation for the Q-function. Instead, I 
used a neural network to represent the Q-function
Use deep Q learning to solve the Cartpole Problem
